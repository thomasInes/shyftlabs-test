# Shyftlab technical assessment.

instructions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wKdytow5L95sS-15vRC8iMEfMnqgtFUljgs_AU0Cxj0/edit#heading=h.2acrkak0exov

The app has been deployed at https://deft-boba-4d8841.netlify.app

## Running the app locally
In a terminal, run:
```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

this should open the application localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Notes

- I used the localstorage as a DB for the sake of simplicity.
- I didn't bother implementing duplication checks upon data insertion
- All the tasks have been completed including the optional ones
- Not the prettiest app, I know :)
